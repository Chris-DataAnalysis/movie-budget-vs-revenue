# Movie Budget vs Revenue Analysis

## Overview  
This project explores the relationship between movie budgets and their revenues using the TMDb movie dataset. By cleaning and analyzing the data, I aimed to uncover insights into how movie budgets impact box office performance across different genres and time periods.

## Dataset  
The dataset was sourced from [TMDb 5000 Movies Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). It includes detailed metadata on 5000 movies, such as budget, revenue, genres, runtime, and release dates.

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (pandas, Jupyter Notebooks) — for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **SQL** (SQLite) — for querying and analysis  
- **Tableau** — for creating visualizations and dashboards  
- **GitHub** — for project version control and sharing

## Key Questions Explored  
- What is the overall distribution of movie budgets and revenues?  
- How does budget correlate with revenue, and are there significant trends or outliers?  
- Which genres have the highest average ROI (Return on Investment)?  
- How does movie runtime relate to revenue? 

## Project Structure  
- `/notebooks/` — Python Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning and exploratory analysis  
- `/sql/` — SQL query files for data analysis

## How to Use  
1. Load the cleaned dataset into your SQL environment (e.g., SQLite).  
2. Run the SQL queries in the `/sql/` folder to reproduce the analysis.
